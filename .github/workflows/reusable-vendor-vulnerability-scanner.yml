    # This job is always run on the build of a `master` base-image.
    # then it copies the branch to be analysed, and scans it.
    # the main reason is that maint-25, maint-26, etc do not have this file
    # committed into them. thus, a workflow_dispatch or workflow_call would
    # not work, and we would not be able to analyse vendor dependecies there.
